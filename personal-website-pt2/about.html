      <h3>Reading</h3>

      <p>
        I love reading. I read 72 books last year and I hope to read as many (or
        more) this year. While I love most genres, my favorites are contemporary
        fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, and romance. Please don't ask me to pick a
        favorite book, it's impossible.

      <h3>Crochet</h3>

      <p>
        I started crocheting in 2023 and it has quickly become another favorite
        hobby. I haven't started writing my own patterns yet, but my goal is to
        write my own pattern this year. I'm currently working on a laptop sleeve
        and a book blanket!

      <h3>Watching TV & Movies</h3>
      <img src="tv-movies.jpeg" alt="Watching TV and Movies" />
      <p>
        If I'm not reading or crocheting in my free time, I'm watching tv or a
        movie. I'm a big Star Wars fan, so I love a good sci-fi, but my comfort
        show is New Girl because it can always make me laugh. I enjoy almost
        everything: comedy, action, sci-fi, drama, and more.
