        My hobbies outside of work include the following:

        <h2>Reading</h2>

        <p>
          I love reading. I read 72 books last year and I hope to read as many
          (or more) this year. While I love most genres, my favorites are
          contemporary fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, and romance. Please don't ask
          me to pick a favorite book, it's impossible.

        <h2>Crochet</h2>
        <img class="about-img" src="crochet.jpeg" alt="Crochet" />
        <p>
          I started crocheting in 2023 and it has quickly become another
          favorite hobby. I haven't started writing my own patterns yet, but my
          goal is to write my own pattern this year. I'm currently working on a
          laptop sleeve and a book blanket!

        <h2>Watching TV & Movies</h2>
        <img class="about-img" src="tv-movies.jpeg" alt="Watching TV" />
        <p>
          If I'm not reading or crocheting in my free time, I'm watching tv or a
          movie. I'm a big Star Wars fan, so I love a good sci-fi, but my
          comfort show is New Girl because it can always make me laugh. I enjoy
          almost everything: comedy, action, sci-fi, drama, and more.
